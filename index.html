                <p>
                    I am a detail-oriented developer that is passionate about readability, single-responsibility,
                    and practicality. "Keep it simple, stupid" is a philosophy I try to follow while writing code.
                    I write code in my free time and keep up with new technologies as often as I can. I am also open-minded
                    to new directions in the industry.

                <h4>People &amp; Leadership</h4>
                <p>
                    I am the type of person that can be friends with anyone. I believe that people are genuine and I always
                    give people the benefit of the doubt. I am laid back while being efficient. I am comfortable in a leadership
                    position; I have been in lead roles before and I have always had good results and maintained good relationships
                    with my team.
